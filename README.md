# Blinkit Sales & Supply Chain Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes Blinkit’s sales dataset to uncover insights into how **product attributes** and **outlet characteristics** (size, location, establishment year) affect overall sales performance.  
The goal is to provide **data-driven recommendations** for inventory allocation, assortment planning, and supply chain optimization.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key sales drivers.  
- Analyze the impact of **item attributes** (e.g., fat content, item type) on demand.  
- Assess how **outlet size, type, and location** influence revenue contribution.  
- Build **visual dashboards** in Power BI to track sales KPIs.  
- Provide actionable insights for **supply chain efficiency** and **customer preference alignment**.  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Larger outlets contribute significantly more to total sales.  
- **Low-fat and regular items** perform differently across outlet types.  
- Older outlets (established earlier) still show strong revenue contribution.  
- Geographic variation highlights the need for **localized inventory distribution**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards (KPIs, Sales Trends, Outlet Analysis)  
- **Excel**: Data cleaning and initial exploration  

---

## 📈 Deliverables
- **EDA Notebook**: Detailed Python analysis.  
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of sales KPIs.  
- **Presentation (PPT)**: Business-oriented summary of findings.  
- **Report (DOCX)**: Consolidated insights and recommendations.  

---

## 📌 Example Use Cases
- Guide **inventory allocation** across outlets of different sizes and locations.  
- Optimize **product assortment** based on fat content and item types.  
- Support **strategic decisions** on outlet expansion vs. refurbishment.  
- Improve **supply chain planning** by aligning stock levels with demand drivers.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Build **predictive models** for demand forecasting.  
- Apply **clustering** to segment outlets by sales behavior.  
- Extend analysis to **logistics cost optimization** and **last-mile delivery**.
